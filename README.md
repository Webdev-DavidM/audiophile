# Ecommerce 

## Overview

This full stack website was my first experience of using the react testing library, typescript and graphql. I have gained alot of experience in these areas integrating them into a react front end with an express backend with a mongoDB database

## Features

- A user can 
- The user can click on an invoice which will show the invoice in more detail, from there they can edit or delete the invoice
- The user can create a new invoice which will create a unique ID for itself and uses todays date as the invoice date
- The form has validation which makes sure the user fills out all the relevant fields.

## My process

Built with

- Mobile-first workflow- the application layout changes for mobile, tablet and desktop views, on mobile there is a downdown menu.
- Developed from Sketch design prototypes
- React testing library used for the front end
- GraphQL
- Typescript
- Express
- MongoDB
- React slick slider used for carousel on the product page
- Material UI for loading spinner

### Still to do
