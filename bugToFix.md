1. tyepscript bug- I want to be able to create components for image gallery and product details but I cant work out hwo to pass props which can be undefined before they are passed to the component. I need to know this so i can abstract and make application neater, currently I cant pass props basically. I need to try stack overflow for this.

2. testing bug- cant seem to test that the button is disabled when the value is 1, product.test.js
